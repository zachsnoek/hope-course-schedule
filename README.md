# hope-course-schedule

## Description
The purpose of this repository is to show general trends in Hope College Music Department enrollment from Fall 2010 to Spring 2019. Data were collected from the [Hope College Schedule of Courses](https://plus.hope.edu/PROD/hxskschd.P_hopeSchedule).</br>

Java code was written by me in a poor attempt to parse and write CSV files in Java (just don't do it). `/src/aggregate_filter_plot.R` was written by an anonymous contributor.
