# hope-course-schedule

## Description
The purpose of this repository is to show general trends in Hope College Music Department enrollment from fall 2010 to spring 2019. All data was collected from the [Hope College Schedule of Courses](https://plus.hope.edu/PROD/hxskschd.P_hopeSchedule).</br>

All Java code was written by me in a poor attempt to parse CSV files in Java (don't do it). `merge.R` in `/src` was written by an anonymous contributor.
